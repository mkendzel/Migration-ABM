Monarch case study results. For all panels, the study region is outlined and based on where simulated agents and monarch observations were located during overwintering months. For panel A, the highlighted cyan region is the monarch summer breeding range that includes the randomly assigned starting locations of agents. The red dots are the overwintering locations, and the arrow indicates the location of the largest overwintering region, Pismo Beach. For B), the black dots are the locations of the observed monarchs during overwintering months. C) the results of the fitted LGCP model for monarch observations. This outlined distribution and the model underlying it is what the simulation results are compared to. D) – G), the predicted distributions based on navigation strategy and k-value. Each represents a population of 1000 agents with their end locations fitted to the model for the observed monarch distribution. H) – K), the relative risk ratio, comparing local model performance at each cell, between the monarch distribution and the results of the simulation directly above. Values approaching 0, where the models have the same predicted value, are in gray. Where the simulation is predicted in higher numbers is in red, and where the monarch model predicts higher numbers is in blue. For example, panel H) is the relative ratio between panel D) and C).
